# Plan for Handling the $products Variable

## 1. Identify the Definition
- The variable `$products` is defined in multiple controllers (`ProductController`, `InventoryController`, and `HomeController`).
- It is consistently defined with an uppercase 'P' in the context of the `Products` model.

## 2. Check for Consistency
- Ensure that all instances of the variable `$products` in the controllers are using the correct case (uppercase 'P') for the `Products` model.

## 3. Update Code if Necessary
- If any instances are found using lowercase 'p' (e.g., `products::all()`), update them to use the correct case (`Products::all()`).

## 4. Testing
- After making any necessary changes, test the application to ensure that the `$products` variable is being passed correctly to the view and that it functions as expected.

## 5. Documentation
- Document any changes made to ensure clarity for future reference.

### Follow-up Steps
- Verify the changes in the controllers.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
